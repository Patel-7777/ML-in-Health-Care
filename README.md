# ML-in-Health-Care
This webapp was developed using Django Framework. And simple form was build using Django Form. The models used to predict the diseases were trained on large Datasets. All the links for datasets and the python notebooks used for model creation are mentioned below in this readme. The webapp can predict following Diseases:
* Diabetes
* Heart Disease

## Models giving best Accuracy of Prediction
We have compared accuracy of all the algorithms and then selected the best algorithm for that particular disease.

Disease | Type of Model | Accuracy
--- | --- | ---
Diabetes | Support Vector Machine | 78.66%
Heart Disease | Logistic Regression  | 85.12%

## Dataset Links
All the datasets were used from kaggle.
* [Diabetes Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database)
* [Heart Disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci)
